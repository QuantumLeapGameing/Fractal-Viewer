# Fractal-Viewer
Allows you to view a variety of fractals :D

If you want the EXE you will need to unpack the file parts useing 7Zip by selecting BOTH .7Z files and pressing "Extract Files".
You can dowload 7Zip from https://www.7-zip.org/

Note that the 7-Zip files are only needed for the EXE. The code is all in the .CS files. So technically if you have a complier
and a brain you probably can just make your own version of the EXE with the provided code if you dont want to unzip the orginal.
